All passengers are thus required to declare the specified items in the <b>Passenger Declaration Form (F88)</b>, prior to arrival in Kenya, and present it to a Customs Official at the point of entry. However, a passenger has a right to query the assessed customs duty and may seek an explanation from the Customs Officer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Payment of Duties</b>: Customs duty is paid at appointed banks located within the terminals, or through mobile banking platform after the Customs Officer generates electronic payment slip.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">See more information on the KRA website link: kra.go.ke, email: <span class=\"s2\">callcentre@kra.go.ke</span>, the Contact Centre on 020 4999 999 or 0711 099 999, or visit any KRA office near you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Commissioner of Customs &amp; Border Control </b></p>\n                        \n                                                    <hr>\n\n                        <div class=\"bottom-wrapper\">\n                            <div class=\"col-wrap leftcont\">\n                                <p>PUBLIC NOTICES 02/11/2023                                </p>\n                            </div>\n\n</div>\n                        <hr>\n\n\n\n                </div>", "notice_url": "https://www.kra.go.ke/news-center/public-notices/2067-clearance-at-passenger-terminals", "notice_pdf": null, "notice_country": "Kenya"},
