KRA implements various\ninitiatives to promote tax compliance, seal revenue loopholes and enhance\nrevenue mobilization.\n\nKRA is committed to continuous improvement and is in the process of upgrading\nthe use of technology to enhance non-intrusive inspection of baggage at all\npoints of entry. Part of this process is to ensure that prohibited and\nrestricted goods are screened out for security purposes.\n\nFor passenger clearance at terminals, KRA informs the public as follows:\n\n**Clearance of Personal items/effects** : All used personal items/effects are\nexempt from customs duties.\n\n**Clearance of new items** : As per the law affecting all **East African\nCountries** , goods of up to the value of **USD 500** for each traveler are\nexempted from import tax, in so far as the baggage is accompanied and declared\nto the Customs Officer. However, KRA is in the process of reviewing this\nregulation to a higher limit and this shall be communicated to the public in\ndue course.\n\n**Baggage handling** : Scanning of travelerâ€™s baggage is done to ensure\ncorrect declarations for purposes of taxation and to screen out prohibited and\nrestricted goods for the safety of all Kenyans. Items flagged out after the\nfirst line x-ray/non-intrusive scanning process will undergo a physical\ninspection by the Customs Officer.\n\n**Determination of Duties** : Where imported goods are subject to customs\nduty, a passenger is required to self-declare the actual price of the item(s).\nThe duty to be paid (if any) shall be based on the actual purchase price as\ndeclared by the passenger/traveler. All passengers are thus required to\ndeclare the specified items in the **Passenger Declaration Form (F88)** ,\nprior to arrival in Kenya, and present it to a Customs Official at the point\nof entry. However, a passenger has a right to query the assessed customs duty\nand may seek an explanation from the Customs Officer.\n\n**Payment of Duties** : Customs duty is paid at appointed banks located within\nthe terminals, or through mobile banking platform after the Customs Officer\ngenerates electronic payment slip.\n\nSee more information on the KRA website link: kra.go.ke, email:\ncallcentre@kra.go.ke, the Contact Centre on 020 4999 999 or 0711 099 999, or\nvisit any KRA office near you.\n\n**Commissioner of Customs & Border Control **\n\n* * *\n\nPUBLIC NOTICES 02/11/2023\n\n* * *\n\n", "url": "https://www.kra.go.ke/news-center/public-notices/2067-clearance-at-passenger-terminals"},
